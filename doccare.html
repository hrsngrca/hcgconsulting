            <h1>Case Study: DocCare, Queens NY</h1>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong><br>
            DocCare operates three primary care offices in Queens, New York, serving a diverse and growing patient population. Despite delivering high-quality care, their quality scores reported to insurers were not capturing the full picture, impacting both recognition and incentive eligibility.</p>
          
            <h2>HEDIS Star Ratings: Supplemental Reporting & Data Strategy</h2>
            <p>Over the course of three reporting years, HCG Consulting helped DocCare improve its HEDIS Star ratings from 1 star to 5 stars. This was achieved by designing and implementing a supplemental data aggregation pipeline that extracted and matched bulk EHR data to payer requirements.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Identified and filled gaps between EHR documentation and claims-based quality metrics</li>
              <li>Built automated processes for tracking and aligning patient-level data with health plan measure definitions</li>
              <li>Submitted supplemental data to Healthfirst, BCBS, UnitedHealthcare, MetroPlus, and Centene/Fidelis/WellCare</li>
              <li>Unlocked significant annual performance bonuses through improved payer scorecards</li>
            </ul>
          
            <h2>PCMH Recertification: Custom Clinical Quality Measures</h2>
            <p>As part of DocCare’s Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) recertification process, HCG Consulting developed custom Clinical Quality Measure (CQM) logic tailored to national and NCQA-aligned standards. These measures filled critical gaps that the EMR vendor could not hard-code into their reporting tools.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Designed and coded custom CQMs using Python and R based on published CMS and NCQA specs</li>
              <li>Validated and matched measure logic against payer documentation to ensure accuracy</li>
              <li>Ensured final numbers alligned with the Measure Authoring and Development Integrated Environment (MADiE) tool test data</li>
              <li>Enabled accurate reporting of preventive care and chronic disease management metrics required for PCMH recognition</li>
              <li>Provided clear documentation and exportable summary reports for submission to certifying bodies</li>
            </ul>
          
            <p>By transforming raw EHR data into validated reports that aligned with national quality frameworks, DocCare was able to demonstrate its high standard of care, maintain key certifications, maximize value-based reimbursement, all without significantly altering clinical workflow.</p>
