            <h1>Case Study: DocCare, Queens NY</h1>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong>  
            DocCare is a busy primary care practice in Queens, New York, serving a diverse and growing patient population. Despite providing excellent care, their reported quality scores to insurers did not reflect the work being done, limiting access to critical incentive payments.</p>

            <p><strong>Our Approach:</strong>  
            HCG Consulting partnered directly with DocCare’s administrative and clinical teams to identify gaps between internal care delivery and external reporting. Through hands-on analysis of existing EMR reports and insurer data portals, we developed a tailored reporting strategy that matched patient care activities with payer requirements.</p>

            <p><strong>Results:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Raised HEDIS Star ratings from 1 star to 5 stars within one reporting cycle</li>
                <li>Unlocked major bonus payouts from Healthfirst, BCBS, UnitedHealthcare, MetroPlus, and Centene/Fidelis/WellCare</li>
                <li>Built repeatable reporting processes to maintain high-quality scores year over year</li>
            </ul>

            <p>By pulling, cleaning, and submitting clinical quality data that the EMR could not previously aggregate, DocCare was able to demonstrate the high level of care they were already providing — and finally receive the recognition and financial incentives they had earned.</p>
